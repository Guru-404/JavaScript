1.
Create a variable named `age`, give your age as its value. Now inside of a `console.log()`, add `3.5` to your age.

---

2.
With `console.log()`, inside the parentheses `()`, take the value of current year and subtract it by `1969`.

---

3.
With `console.log()`, inside the parentheses divide `65` by `240`.

---

4.
With `console.log()`, inside the parentheses multiply `0.2708` with `100`.

---

5.
What will be the value of `age` after this code runs?

(**NOTE:** you have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code.)

```jsx
let age = 23;
age + 2;     //after 2 years
```

---

6.
What will be the value of `avg` after this code runs?

(**NOTE:** you have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code.)

```jsx
let hindi = 80;
let eng = 80;
let math = 80;
let avg = (hindi + eng + math) / 3;
```

---

7.
Write a program to convert a temperature given in Kelvin unit to Celsius and then Fahrenheit.

These are the conversation standards for the temperature conversion between different units.

```jsx
    Celsius = Kelvin - 273

    Fahrenheit = (9/5) * Celsius + 32
```

(**HINT:** The temperature once given in the Kelvin unit shouldn’t get changed by any means in the program, so choose the data type for your variables wisely.)
